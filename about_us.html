                    Greetings
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, I would like to offer my sincerest welcome to the Cambridge University Korean Society (CUKS). Our members consist of both Korean and non-Korean students studying here in Cambridge, and we are a registered society of the Cambridge University Student Union (CUSU).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to serve as a medium of social and academic interaction for all Korean undergraduate and graduate students within the university, and also to promote Korea and Korean culture to the students of non-Korean origin. Over the next year, we plan to hold various activities, some of them in conjunction with the Faculty of East Asian Studies and Cambridge East Asian Cultural Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these great social and academic activities, we will host a number of recruitment events, which will help our members in deciding their future career paths. We will advertise and invite various recruitment dinners organised by both Korean and multi-national companies from different industries. All these events will be announced via email, so please check your email regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above all, we are here to promote and encourage long-lasting, deep friendships between our members. Our social and academic events will provide you with a valuable opportunity to meet people not only from Korea, but from various places around the world with fascinating and diverse backgrounds. We hope that you meet and befriend true, lasting companions in your life through our society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our sponsors and our committee members, who make all these things possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you, and with best wishes,<br>
