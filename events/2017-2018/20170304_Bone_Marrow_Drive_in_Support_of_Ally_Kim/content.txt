For those of you who can make it this Saturday (4th March) and Sunday (5th March) to one of our venues to take part in a bone marrow registering drive for Ally, we would be very grateful!

Ally Kim is a two year old baby of Korean descent diagnosed with Chronic Granulomatous Disorder (CGD), an extremely life threatening condition where his immune system does not work properly. Ally needs a bone marrow transplant procedure which could cure him completely, and CUKS are more than happy to be able to help and host a registration drive. 

WE ARE INVITING students and residents of Cambridge who are of Korean descent, and any other Asian students/residents to join us this weekend to register. It takes 2 minutes and consists of a simple swab to join the registry; the donation itself (should a match occur) is equally simple and is similar to giving blood (no drills involved!). The event we are hosting is the preliminary swab registration.

PLEASE SHARE AMONG FRIENDS - we want as many people as can come!!

LOCATION AND TIMES:
Saturday 4th March, 9am~4pm: Trinity College, Blue Boar Common Room

Sunday 5th March, 10am~4pm: Pembroke College, New Common Room
